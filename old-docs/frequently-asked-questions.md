#### What is Modmail?

Modmail is a Discord bot, similar to Reddit's Modmail feature. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users - and vice versa - in a seamless way.

#### Can I invite Modmail?

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the bot, there is not a global invite link. Nonetheless, you can obtain a free copy of Modmail for your server. Follow the official tutorial at [https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation). However, if you don’t want the hassle of installing and maintaining Modmail, we offer installation, hosting, and other cool perks for [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kyber).

#### How does Modmail work?

Modmail uses the Discord API to interact with the platform. When someone sends a DM to the bot, it will create a new thread. Members of the moderation team can help the user and once the conversation ended, you will have access to a beautiful log of it online.

#### Is Modmail safe?

Your Modmail bot is safe as long as you don't share your bot's token. If you share your token, a "hacker" can take control over your bot. If you shared your bot token by mistake, regenerate a new token via the Discord Developer Portal.

#### Where is my data stored?

All your data including settings, blocked users, logs, installed plugins etc. are stored in your MongoDB database. The bot files only contain the stuff needed to run the bot. This means you can move your bot to a different host and still have your data intact, as long as you use the same MongoDB URI.

#### Can I request new features?

Modmail is an open-source project, which means you can easily add or request new features. You can make an issue or submit a pull request to the development branch on the repository. [Check out the contribution guidelines.](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
