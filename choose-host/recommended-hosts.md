{% hint style="warning" %} Be sure to research hosting providers before renting a server from one. Our recommendations and experiences should be used as recommendations only, we cannot guarantee any specific experience with any provider, nor can we provide billing or other support regarding the operating system, or availability of servers.

{% hint style="info" %} The Modmail Team always recommends exercising security best practices with any server. While we are unable to provide official support on this matter, we can recommend some good places to start:

- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-securing-your-linux-vps)
- [Plesk Recommendations](https://www.plesk.com/blog/various/how-to-secure-your-linux-server-a-detailed-guide/#)
- [ninjaOne Recommendations](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/key-steps-for-a-more-secure-linux-server/)
- [Linux.org Fourms Recommendations](https://www.linux.org/threads/the-ultimate-guide-to-reasonable-security-for-your-debian-ubuntu-linux-server-for-new-linux-admins.49199/)

    *Consider these a starting point, but be sure to do your own research. The Modmail Team holds no liability for any security mishaps that may occur with a server not rented by us and under our full, direct, and exclusive control. (in other words: we aren't responsible for your server)

## PaaS Providers

PaaS Hosting is usually more expensive, but a simpler to setup solution, which removes the need for securing a server, ssh configurations, terminal usage, and similar. However, because of this the platforms are usually more restricted, and difficult to troubleshoot. Despite this they are still an adequate and supported option.
