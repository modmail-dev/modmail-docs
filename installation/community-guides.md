## [Oracle Guide](http://docs.lidistat67.xyz/) by lidistat67

Oracle Cloud Compute is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. Unlike Railway and Heroku, Oracle gives you access to a VPS where you can have a more direct control of your instance. Oracle is a reputable company known for owning products such as Java, VirtualBox, MySQL, etc. Oracle Cloud offers 3,000 OCPU hours and 18,000 GB hours per month. This is equivalent to 24 GB of RAM and 4 OCPUs. TL;DR, Oracle offers powerful instances for free! Oracle requires a credit card for verification but will never charge you as long as you are on their free plan. The setup is similar to self-hosting Modmail as Oracle offers a VPS.
