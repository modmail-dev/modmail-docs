## [Replit Guide](https://gist.github.com/anondev-sudo/24978429b85b44348bcff5c0885afe82) by AnonDev

An online code execution environment that costs $7 USD per month. However, hosting on Replit is often unstable, and thus not recommended. For the up-to-date pricing info check out their [pricing](https://replit.com/pricing) page.

## [Northflank](https://project-mei.xyz/blog/modmail-on-northflank/) Guide by raidensakura

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to uptime and reliability issues on Northflank, the creator of this guide and the Modmail team has deprecated this hosting method. We strongly recommend to use a different host. More information can be read [here](https://discord.com/channels/1079074933008781362/1079077917771964426/1391562969443340360).

Northflank is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Railway that offers abilities to run micro-services like bots, schedule jobs that run periodically and databases with a powerful UI, API and CLI. Their panel is a bit more advanced as compared to Railway but comes with the perk of more customization and features. You will need a valid payment method to verify your account, but will unlock a free tier project that's separated from paid resources. They will not charge your card if you go over resource usage as you have limited allocation per service.

## [Oracle Guide](http://docs.lidistat67.xyz/) by lidistat67

Oracle Cloud Compute is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. Unlike Railway and Heroku, Oracle gives you access to a VPS where you can have a more direct control of your instance. Oracle is a reputable company known for owning products such as Java, VirtualBox, MySQL, etc. Oracle Cloud offers 3,000 OCPU hours and 18,000 GB hours per month. This is equivalent to 24 GB of RAM and 4 OCPUs. TL;DR, Oracle offers powerful instances for free! Oracle requires a credit card for verification but will never charge you as long as you are on their free plan. The setup is similar to self-hosting Modmail as Oracle offers a VPS.
